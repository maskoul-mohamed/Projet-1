    <h3>Announcement</h3>
    <blockquote>
        I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. 
        This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. 
        I’d like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat...
